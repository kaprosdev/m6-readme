Going full nerd shit with this I'm sorry

## Roles
- Everyone should have the `Everyone` role, which provides serverwide admin perms.  
- I'm assigning it manually to anyone who shows up, cause I don't think I can assign it automatically (and I'd rather not, in case some random or spambot gets hold of an invite by accident).
- Since everyone has admin perms in their topmost role it's literally impossible to mess perms up.
  - If anyone wants a role for a joke or a name color, just make it.
  - There's no channel permissions. Everyone can see (and delete) every message in every channel. 
    - Please don't be a dick and delete other people's messages unless there's a really good obvious reason.

## Other than that
- Probably don't talk about shit going down in other servers (including TMF) unless it's immediately relevant.
  - This isn't a revenge Discord some kid might set up to plan a raid on a server that wronged them.
  - It's just a place to play games and talk about current events (among other things).
    - more specifically, filling in the overlap between "people who are generally okay with Moss and Owl" and "Moss and Owl"
